Elldev maintaines a filesystem on the user's server. You can maintain a list of assets/files to be uploaded via ftp to the server. Here also you can create/move/delete pages. Actual urls of pages directly correspond to their locations on the server for ease of use.

## design control

You can control every aspect of an element's design to a very high degree. Elldev abstracts away the css inconstistancies. Position is controlled in terms of anchors which can bae added on all 4 sides of an element to position/cnchor it exactly as desited in the responsive environment of a modern website.

## element hierarchy

The element browser lets you see the sturcture/tree of the page and easily browse through it. It also aligns itself with whatever element you are currently editing so that it is always where you are.
